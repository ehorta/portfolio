<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>My name is Elisa. I am a teenager who is interested in technology and design. I hope to some day work in the tech industry. 
I like to play field hockey and lacrosse. I extremely dislike bananas and clingy people. 
A fun fact is that I adopted a stray cat. My favorite webpages are <a> href= "www.teenvogue.com"> here </a> and <a> href= "www.cracked.com"> here</a> </p>
