<p style="color:white;">I am a teenager who is interested in technology and design. I hope to some day work in the tech industry. 
I like to play field hockey and lacrosse. I extremely dislike bananas and clingy people. 
A fun fact is that I adopted a stray cat. My favorite webpages are <a href="www.teenvogue.com">teen vogue</a> and <a href="www.cracked">cracked</a>. </p>

<p style="color:white;">I have recently made a game on Scratch! You get to move the airplane with the up and down arrows to avoid the clouds and turbulance in your way.</p>
